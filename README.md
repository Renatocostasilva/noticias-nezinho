## Troubleshooting

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'django.utils.six'

If you encounter this error, it's because the `django-disqus` package is trying to import `django.utils.six`, which was removed in recent Django versions. We've addressed this issue in two ways:

1. **Solution 1 (Implemented)**: We've removed the dependency on `django-disqus` and implemented a native comments system instead.

2. **Solution 2 (Alternative)**: If you still want to use Disqus, you can run the `disqus_fix.py` script to patch the package:
   ```
   python disqus_fix.py
   ```
   This script replaces the problematic import with a compatible one.

### OperationalError: no such table: news_news

If you encounter this error, it means that the database tables were not created correctly. We've provided a script to fix this issue:

```
python fix_database.py
```

This script will:
1. Remove the existing database
2. Remove all migration files
3. Create new migrations
4. Apply the migrations
5. Offer to create a superuser
6. Offer to start the server

### Initializing the Database with Sample Data

After setting up the database, you can populate it with sample data using:

```
python init_data.py
```

This script will:
1. Create sample categories (Politics, Economy, Technology, Sports, Entertainment, Health)
2. Create sample news articles with content and images
3. Add tags to the articles
4. Use the first superuser as the author for all articles

Note: You must create a superuser before running this script.
